# JavaCoreConcept
Welcome to JavaCoreConcept! This repository is a structured collection of Java questions and solutions, organized by topics. It's designed to help you learn Java step-by-step by solving questions on each topic, building a solid foundation in Java programming.

## üìù Project Overview
In this repository, each folder represents a Java topic, containing questions and solutions. The goal is to master each topic through problem-solving, making it a great resource for beginners and intermediate learners.


 ## Topics and Questions

1. Introduction to Java: Basic syntax and structure, first programs.
2. Data Types and Variables: Questions on primitive types, type conversion, and variables.
3. Operators: Arithmetic, relational, and logical operator exercises.
4. Control Structures: Conditionals (`if-else`, `switch`), and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
5. Methods: Method creation, overloading, recursion, and more.
6. Arrays: Single-dimensional, multidimensional arrays, array manipulation questions.
7. Strings: String manipulation, character handling, common string problems.
8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Questions on classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
9. Exception Handling: Basic exception handling questions.
10. Basic Data Structures: Lists, Sets, Maps, and their usage in problem-solving.

Each topic folder contains:
- README.md: An introduction to the topic and a list of questions.
- Java files: Each file represents a question with a solution, including comments explaining the approach.
